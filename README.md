# COINR

COINR is a Web3 solution that enables users to swap Ethereum to INR effortlessly. Using COINR users can swap Ethereum from their wallet directly to INR in their bank account. It is a seamless process and is much decentralized than crypto exchanges present today.

The webapp has been hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and can be accessed at [https://tourmaline-custard-d4f36c.netlify.app/](https://tourmaline-custard-d4f36c.netlify.app/) 

## Current features

The current version of the webapp allows users to signup by providing their details, login using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and swap Ethereum from their Metamask wallet into CINR tokens. Instructions on how to perform this operation have been provided in the [help](https://tourmaline-custard-d4f36c.netlify.app/help) page for the webapp.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
